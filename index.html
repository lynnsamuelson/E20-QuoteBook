      <p id="quote1" class="quote">“I never dreamed about success. I worked for it.” —Estée Lauder</p>
      <p id="quote2" class="quote">“Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the best of which you are capable.” —John Wooden</p>
      <p class="quote">"Nothing in the world can take the place of Persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. The slogan 'Press On' has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race." —Calvin Coolidge</p>
      <p class="quote">“Success usually comes to those who are too busy looking for it.” — Henry David Thoreau</p>
